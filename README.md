# FirstLaravelProject

This is my first web project developed with **Laravel**, marking the beginning of my immersion in **PHP** and this powerful framework. As a fourth-year Computer Engineering student, this project serves as a foundation to apply my software architecture knowledge in a web development environment.

## üöÄ About the Project

The main goal of this project is a simple **To-Do List Management** application that allows for:

* **Viewing** existing tasks.
* **Adding** new tasks.
* **Marking** tasks as completed.
* **Deleting** tasks.

Through this project, I'm familiarizing myself with Laravel's fundamentals, including the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, Eloquent ORM, database migrations, and the routing system.
